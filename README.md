# WastEd
WastEd is a game about Ed - the trash can.

This game was made for the #KLUJAM 2020 Winter Edition over the weekend solely by myself. 

**Theme: Choose a path.**

### Story:

_You've been mysteriously brought to live by a suspicious radiating liquid, which somebody threw away into your body. You don't know why you live, but one thing you know for sure: those damn robocoons, who always feast on your brethren, need to die._

### Gameplay:

Manage through 4 different levels, but beware: whenever you choose one path, another closes. So be wary of that. Live through terrible traps and bring justice to each robocoon you find. You might even modify yourself and take whats left from those 'coons.

[IMPORTANT!]

As of now there is just one level modeled - the other paths serve as ... proof of concept :D The idea would be to finish each level in under one minute, modifying your body with the awarded powerups, and destroying the final boss coon with your newly gained superpowers.

### Diversifiers:

* Future retro: look at that synthwave

* Character creator: I mean... you modify your trash can.

* Permanent consequences: choose a path and another one closes

* Not a single trash panda: may survive
